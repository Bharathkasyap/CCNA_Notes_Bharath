# DHCP Lecture Notes for CCNA Beginners

## Lecture Overview

This lecture covers the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, aligning with **CCNA exam topics 4.3** ("Explain the role of DHCP and DNS within the network") and **4.6** ("Configure and verify DHCP client and relay"). DHCP enables client devices (e.g., PCs, phones) to automatically obtain network configuration parameters like IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server, reducing manual configuration. The lecture explains DHCP’s purpose, the four-message DORA process (Discover, Offer, Request, Ack), and Cisco IOS configuration for DHCP server, relay agent, and client roles. It uses a network with a PC, routers (R1, R2), and a DHCP server (SRV1) for demonstrations, building on prior topics like IP addressing (Days 5–6, 24–26), DNS (previous lecture), and routing (Day 34). A bonus practice question from Boson Software’s ExSim for CCNA is included.

**Lecture Objectives**:
- **Understand DHCP Purpose**: Explain how DHCP automates network configuration for clients.
- **Describe Basic Functions**: Outline the DORA process, UDP ports (67 server, 68 client), and lease concept.
- **Configure DHCP in Cisco IOS**: Set up a router as a DHCP server (`ip dhcp pool`), relay agent (`ip helper-address`), and client (`ip address dhcp`).
- **Prepare for Exam**: Master topics 4.3 and 4.6, focusing on DHCP’s role and configurations.
- **Verify Configurations**: Use Windows commands (`ipconfig /all`, `/release`, `/renew`) and Cisco IOS commands (`show ip dhcp binding`) to verify settings.

**Network Topology**:

                                         |       |                |
                                         |       |                |
                                         +-------| PC1: 192.168.1.x |
                                         |       | (DHCP client)  |
                                         +-------+----------------+
```
- **Devices**:
  - **SRV1**: DHCP server (192.168.10.10) for enterprise scenarios.
  - **R1**: Router connected to SRV1 (G0/0) and SW1 (G0/1, 192.168.1.1/24); can be DHCP server, relay, or client.
  - **SW1**: Switch connecting R1 to PC1 (DHCP client, 192.168.1.x).
  - **PC1**: Windows PC, obtains IP via DHCP (e.g., 192.168.1.11).
- **Note**: Connectivity to SRV1 via OSPF/static routes (from Day 34). R1’s roles (server, relay, client) demonstrated separately.
- **Requirements (Examples)**:
  1. Verify PC1’s DHCP settings (`ipconfig /all`).
  2. Release/renew PC1’s IP (`ipconfig /release`, `/renew`).
  3. Configure R1 as DHCP server for 192.168.1.0/24, excluding 192.168.1.1–10.
  4. Configure R1 as relay agent to forward PC1’s requests to SRV1.
  5. Configure R2 as DHCP client on G0/1.

**Analogy**: DHCP is like a hotel concierge assigning room numbers (IP addresses), directions (default gateway), and amenities (DNS server) to guests (clients) automatically. A router as a DHCP server is the concierge, a relay agent is a messenger forwarding requests to a central concierge (SRV1), and a client is a guest asking for a room.

**Lifelong Retention Tip**: Visualize PC1 broadcasting a DHCP Discover to R1 or SRV1, receiving an IP like 192.168.1.11. In Packet Tracer, configure `ip dhcp pool`, assign PC1 an IP, and verify with `show ip dhcp binding`. Create flashcards: “DHCP ports? Server 67, client 68. DORA? Discover, Offer, Request, Ack.” Practice 3 times daily for a week.

## Purpose of DHCP

**Purpose**: DHCP automatically assigns network configuration parameters (IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server) to client devices (e.g., PCs, phones), eliminating manual configuration.

**Key Points**:
- **Automation**: Clients (e.g., PC1) learn IP (e.g., 192.168.1.11), subnet mask (/24), default gateway (192.168.1.1), and DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8) via DHCP.
- **Use Case**: Common in home (router as DHCP server) and enterprise networks (Windows/Linux server); critical for WiFi (e.g., cafes, airports).
- **Static vs. Dynamic**: Routers/servers use static IPs; clients use DHCP for dynamic IPs.
- **Lease Time**: IPs are leased (e.g., 5 hours 30 minutes), not permanent, to preserve address pools (e.g., cafe WiFi reuses IPs after guests leave).
- **CCNA Focus**: Understand DHCP’s role (topic 4.3) and configuration/verification (topic 4.6).

**Windows Commands**:
```plaintext
C:\> ipconfig /all
C:\> ipconfig /release
C:\> ipconfig /renew
```

**Example (on PC1)**:
```plaintext
C:\> ipconfig /all
   DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.167 (Preferred)
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1
   DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1
   DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1
   Lease Obtained. . . . . . . . . . : [Timestamp]
   Lease Expires . . . . . . . . . . : [Timestamp + 5h30m]
C:\> ipconfig /release
C:\> ipconfig /renew
```

**Observations**:
- **ipconfig /all**: Shows DHCP-enabled, IP (192.168.0.167, “preferred”), subnet, gateway, DNS, lease times.
- **ipconfig /release**: Releases IP (192.168.0.167) to DHCP server (192.168.0.1).
- **ipconfig /renew**: Triggers DORA process, reassigns IP (often same if available).
- **Home Network**: Router (192.168.0.1) often serves as DHCP, DNS, and gateway.

**Comparison to Prior Content**:
- **DNS Lecture**: DNS resolves names (e.g., `youtube.com` → 172.217.25.110); DHCP assigns DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
- **IP Addressing (Days 5–6, 24–26)**: DHCP assigns IPv4 addresses/subnets learned in addressing labs.
- **Extended ACLs (Day 35)**: ACLs can block DHCP (e.g., `deny udp any any eq 67 68`).

**Comparison to Other CCNA Topics**:
- **Day 30 (Ports)**: DHCP uses UDP 67 (server), 68 (client); critical for ACLs/firewalls.
- **OSPF (Day 34)**: Ensures routes to DHCP server (e.g., SRV1 at 192.168.10.10).
- **Security (Section 5.0)**: DHCP snooping (later topic) prevents rogue servers.

**Analogy**: DHCP is like an airport gate agent assigning seats (IPs) and boarding passes (gateway, DNS) to passengers (clients) dynamically, with a time limit (lease) to free seats for others.

**Lifelong Retention Tip**: On a Windows PC, run `ipconfig /all`, note DHCP settings, try `/release` and `/renew`. Flashcard: “DHCP assigns? IP, subnet, gateway, DNS. Ports? 67 server, 68 client.” Practice 3 times.

## Basic Functions of DHCP

**Purpose**: DHCP uses a four-message process (DORA: Discover, Offer, Request, Ack) to lease IP addresses and configurations to clients, with UDP ports 67 (server) and 68 (client).

**Key Concepts**:
- **DORA Process**:
  - **Discover**: Client broadcasts (0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255, UDP 68 → 67) to find DHCP servers.
  - **Offer**: Server unicasts/broadcasts (UDP 67 → 68) an IP offer (e.g., 192.168.1.11), gateway, DNS, lease time.
  - **Request**: Client broadcasts (0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255, UDP 68 → 67) to accept offer, specifying server.
  - **Ack**: Server unicasts/broadcasts (UDP 67 → 68) confirmation, client configures IP.
- **Ports**: Server (UDP 67), client (UDP 68); unlike DNS (both use 53), client port is fixed.
- **Broadcast vs. Unicast**:
  - Discover/Request: Always broadcast (client lacks IP or targets multiple servers).
  - Offer/Ack: Unicast if client sets Bootp flag to unicast; broadcast if client cannot accept unicast (no IP configured).
- **Lease**: IPs leased (e.g., 5h30m); clients request same IP (“preferred”) if available.
- **Options**: Include lease time (51), DNS server (6), default gateway (3); not required for CCNA.
- **Release**: Client sends unicast Release (UDP 68 → 67) to free IP (`ipconfig /release`).

**Wireshark Example**:
- **Release**: PC (192.168.0.167) → server (192.168.0.1), UDP 68 → 67, option 53 (Release).
- **Discover**: PC (0.0.0.0) → 255.255.255.255, UDP 68 → 67, broadcast MAC (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), requests 192.168.0.167.
- **Offer**: Server → PC, UDP 67 → 68, unicast (if Bootp flag unicast), offers 192.168.0.167, DNS (8.8.8.8), gateway (192.168.0.1).
- **Request**: PC (0.0.0.0) → 255.255.255.255, UDP 68 → 67, broadcast, option 54 (server IP).
- **Ack**: Server → PC, UDP 67 → 68, unicast, confirms 192.168.0.167.

**Observations**:
- **DORA**: Discover/Request (broadcast, client-initiated), Offer/Ack (unicast/broadcast, server-initiated).
- **DHCP Relay**: Forwards client broadcasts to remote server (unicast) if server not in subnet.
- **CCNA Focus**: Know DORA, ports 67/68, broadcast vs. unicast; options (e.g., 53, 54) optional.

**Comparison to Prior Content**:
- **DNS Lecture**: DHCP assigns DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8); DNS uses UDP 53, DHCP uses 67/68.
- **NTP Lecture (Day 37)**: NTP (UDP 123) syncs time; DHCP assigns IPs for NTP server access.
- **Extended ACLs (Day 35)**: ACLs can block DHCP (e.g., `deny udp any any eq 67 68`).

**Comparison to Other CCNA Topics**:
- **Day 30 (Ports)**: DHCP (UDP 67/68) vs. DNS (53), NTP (123).
- **OSPF (Day 34)**: Routes needed for relay to reach DHCP server.
- **Security (Section 5.0)**: DHCP snooping mitigates rogue servers (later topic).

**Analogy**: DORA is like a customer (client) shouting for a waiter (Discover), getting a menu offer (Offer), ordering a dish (Request), and receiving confirmation (Ack). The relay agent is a runner carrying the order to a kitchen in another building.

**Lifelong Retention Tip**: In Packet Tracer, set PC1 to DHCP, capture DORA in simulation mode. Flashcard: “DORA? Discover (broadcast), Offer (unicast), Request (broadcast), Ack (unicast). Ports? 67 server, 68 client.” Practice 3 times.

## Configuring DHCP in Cisco IOS

**Purpose**: Configure a Cisco router as a DHCP server (assign IPs), relay agent (forward to remote server), or client (obtain IP).

**Commands**:
- **DHCP Server (on R1)**:
```plaintext
R1(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
R1(config)# ip dhcp pool LAN_POOL
R1(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.1.0 /24
R1(dhcp-config)# dns-server 8.8.8.8
R1(dhcp-config)# domain-name jeremysitlab.com
R1(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.1.1
R1(dhcp-config)# lease 0 5 30
```
- **DHCP Relay Agent (on R1, G0/1)**:
```plaintext
R1(config)# interface g0/1
R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 192.168.10.10
```
- **DHCP Client (on R2, G0/1)**:
```plaintext
R2(config)# interface g0/1
R2(config-if)# ip address dhcp
```

**Verification**:
- **DHCP Server (R1)**:
```plaintext
R1# show ip dhcp binding
Bindings from all pools not associated with VRF:
IP address      Client-ID/              Lease expiration        Type
                Hardware address
192.168.1.11    0063.6973.636f.2d30.   [Timestamp + 5h30m]     Automatic
                3030.302e.3030.3030.
                2e30.3030.312d.4769.
                302f.31
```
- **DHCP Relay (R1)**:
```plaintext
R1# show ip interface g0/1
GigabitEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up
  Internet address is 192.168.1.1/24
  Helper-address is 192.168.10.10
```
- **DHCP Client (R2)**:
```plaintext
R2# show ip interface g0/1
GigabitEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up
  Internet address is 192.168.1.100/24 (address determined by DHCP)
```

**Example Scenarios**:
- **DHCP Server**:
  - PC1 sends Discover; R1 assigns 192.168.1.11 (first available after excluded 1–10), DNS (8.8.8.8), gateway (192.168.1.1), lease (5h30m).
  - PC1 verifies: `ipconfig /all` shows 192.168.1.11, jeremysitlab.com, 8.8.8.8.
- **DHCP Relay**:
  - PC1 broadcasts Discover; R1 (G0/1) forwards to SRV1 (192.168.10.10) as unicast.
  - SRV1 offers 192.168.1.100; R1 forwards to PC1; DORA completes.
- **DHCP Client**:
  - R2 (G0/1) sends Discover; SRV1 assigns 192.168.1.100; R2 configures G0/1.

**Observations**:
- **Server**: `ip dhcp pool` defines subnet (192.168.1.0/24), excludes addresses (1–10), sets DNS, gateway, lease.
- **Relay**: `ip helper-address` forwards broadcasts to SRV1; requires route to 192.168.10.10.
- **Client**: `ip address dhcp` rare for routers (static IPs preferred); assigns dynamic IP.
- **Note**: Home routers often act as DHCP servers; enterprises use Windows/Linux servers.

**Comparison to Prior Content**:
- **DNS Lecture**: DHCP assigns DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8); DNS resolves names post-DHCP.
- **NTP Lecture (Day 37)**: DHCP assigns IPs for NTP server access (e.g., `time.google.com`).
- **Extended ACLs (Day 35)**: ACLs can block DHCP (e.g., `deny udp any host 192.168.10.10 eq 67`).

**Comparison to Other CCNA Topics**:
- **Day 30 (Ports)**: DHCP (UDP 67/68) vs. DNS (53), NTP (123).
- **OSPF (Day 34)**: Routes needed for relay to reach SRV1.
- **Security (Section 5.0)**: DHCP snooping prevents unauthorized servers.

**Analogy**: R1 as a DHCP server is a concierge assigning rooms (IPs) to guests (PCs). As a relay, it’s a messenger forwarding requests to a central concierge (SRV1). As a client, it’s a guest asking for a room.

**Lifelong Retention Tip**: In Packet Tracer, configure `ip dhcp pool`, assign PC1 an IP, verify with `show ip dhcp binding`. Set `ip helper-address` on R1, check `show ip interface`. Flashcard: “DHCP server? `ip dhcp pool`. Relay? `ip helper-address`.” Practice 3 times.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **PC1 Fails to Get IP**:
  - **Issue**: `ipconfig /renew` fails; no IP assigned.
  - **Cause**: No DHCP server in subnet, or relay misconfigured.
  - **Fix**: Verify `ip dhcp pool` on R1 or `ip helper-address 192.168.10.10` on G0/1; check route to SRV1.
- **Wrong IP Assigned**:
  - **Issue**: PC1 gets IP outside 192.168.1.0/24.
  - **Cause**: Incorrect `network` in `ip dhcp pool` or overlapping pools.
  - **Fix**: Verify `network 192.168.1.0 /24` in pool; check `show ip dhcp pool`.
- **Relay Fails**:
  - **Issue**: PC1’s Discover not reaching SRV1.
  - **Cause**: Missing `ip helper-address` or no route to 192.168.10.10.
  - **Fix**: Configure `ip helper-address 192.168.10.10` on G0/1; verify `ip route` or OSPF.
- **R2 DHCP Client Fails**:
  - **Issue**: R2’s G0/1 gets no IP (`ip address dhcp`).
  - **Cause**: No DHCP server reachable or UDP 67/68 blocked.
  - **Fix**: Verify server (SRV1) reachable, check ACLs (`show access-lists`).

**Analogy**: Troubleshooting DHCP is like ensuring a hotel guest (PC1) gets a room key: check if the concierge (R1) is assigning rooms (`ip dhcp pool`), forwarding requests (`ip helper-address`), or if the phone line (UDP 67/68) is blocked.

**Lifelong Retention Tip**: In Packet Tracer, simulate failed `ipconfig /renew` (remove `ip dhcp pool`), check `show ip dhcp binding`, reconfigure pool. Checklist: “No IP? Check pool, helper-address, routes, UDP 67/68.” Practice 3 times.
